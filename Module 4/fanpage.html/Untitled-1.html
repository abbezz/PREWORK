        Mahamoud was born in Rinkeby, part of the Swedish Million Programme for affordable housing in northwest Stockholm, and grew up with his mother and five siblings. Yasin is of Somali background. The name Yasin Byn hints at his connection to Rinkeby, which is popularly called Byn ("the village").[2] He started in hip hop music recording online videos with his childhood friends, including Jaffar Byn. That led to him joining the Swedish hip hop collective Byn Block Entertainment (BBE) with aspiring artists mostly from Rinkeby. BBE subsequently started collaborating with artists from the wider Järva region, forming the larger hip hop collective Ghetto Superstars.[3] In 2016, his music was included in the Ghetto Superstars compilation album Allstars.

        In 2019, he released his official debut single "DSGIS", an abbreviation of det som göms i snö (that which is hidden in snow) from a Swedish proverb.[4] The follow-up single "XO" in collaboration with Swedish rapper Dree Low topped Sverigetopplistan, the Swedish national record chart. Yasin's album Handen under Mona Lisas kjol (Pt:1) topped the Swedish album chart. His most recent single, "Talk 2 Me", was released in December 2020 and reached the first spot on the Swedish Singles Chart.[5]
